## What is Pomoday?

![](screenshot.png)

Pomoday is an easy to use, yet powerful and flexible web-based task management software that you can use with just a keyboard.

It's flexible and doesn't tie with any productivity methodologies, that means, you
can customize and use it in anyway you want, try implementing yourself a GTD or Kanban or
Pomodoro workflow with it.

## Features

1. Task management (of course)
2. Keyboard only workflow
3. Built-in time tracker
4. Activities log to get an overview on how you spent your day
5. Dark mode
6. (A lot coming...)

## Usage and Installation

There are two ways to use Pomoday:

### Online version

You can use the online version at https://pomoday.app

### Self-hosted version

Please make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

To host Pomoday locally or on your own server:

1. Clone this repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/huytd/pomoday-v2
  ```
2. Install the dependencies
  ```
  npm install
  ```
3. Build
  ```
  npm run dist
  ```
4. Now you can deploy the `dist` folder anywhere, just like a static web page

It's recomended to deploy it to [now.sh](https://now.sh), because it's easy:

```
$ cd dist
$ now
```

## Development

To run it locally during development, use:

```
npm run dev
```

## Docker

This repo includes a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` to easily run the project in a container. Just run the following two commands to build the container image and start it up:

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Similar Projects

- [taskbook](https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook): This is an awesome task management application that actually works, and works very well for everyone who likes to live in a command line. Pomoday was also heavily inspired by Taskbook, as you can see from the UI and the keyboard-only command interfaces.

## Backers and Sponsors

I would like to give a special thanks to all of the advisors and backers who sponsored this project since day-zero.
